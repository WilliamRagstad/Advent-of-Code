### 👋 *Welcome!*

This is a repository with all of my Advent of Code solutions.
*It is work in progress as I'm still adding solutions from previous runs.*
Every year I try to learn a new language as fast as possible through solving problems in it.

> ### *About* Advent of Code 🎁🎄
> AoC is like an advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.
> People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other. \

## Notice
My solutions aren't always the most efficient, idiomatic or readable as I try to solve the problems as quickly as possible.
I'm hoping to improve on both of these things in the future.
